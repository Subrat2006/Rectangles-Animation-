# Rectangles (Animation)
In this Python file (or .py file), we will do a simple animation (i.e., Rectangles) using the ```Turtle Module```.

# About this Python Document
This documents (or project) needs the following requirements:
```
Python IDLE (or Visual Studio Code, according to the preferance)
Turtle Module (which is pre-installed in most cases)
```
[Click here](Rectangles.py) for going to the codes of this project!

# About the program
This program enables us to see the arrangement of Rectangular blocks in a systematic order (according to the size of the Blocks)

# Rules
The rules of this program would be followed by the Computer itself and you have to guess it!

Actually, I am leaving here the pattern for you all:

1) The Smaller Block can't go above the Bigger Block!
2) The Blocks would be arranged in a systematic order in ascending order (from the top)!
3) There would be only 3 columns, where the Rectangular Blocks can go.

In this way, they will arrange every block in a systematic order!

Wait and see all this till last!
